Project Title: Music Genre Classification using Spectral Analysis and Random Forest Classifier

Musical genres are categorical labels created by humans to characterize pieces of music. A musical genre is characterized by the common characteristics shared by its members. These characteristics typically are related to the instrumentation, rhythmic structure, and harmonic content of the music. Therefore, in this project, we will implement our method using multi-class SVM to classify miscellaneous musical genres such as Blues, Classical, Country, Disco, Hip-hop, Jazz, Metal, Pop, Reggae, and Rock, we rely purely on Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) to characterize the dataset. Once the features are extracted, different standard machine learning techniques which are independent of the specific application area will be used as classifiers. Hence, the main objective of this project is to make better musical genres prediction as well as comparing predictive performance of different machine learning classifiers including Support Vector Machine(SVM), Random Forest, knearest Neighbor (KNN) and Gradient Boosting to investigate the results. At the end, regarding to measure the success of our study, we will make genre confusion matrix and also use an accuracy criterion in order to evaluate the results for music genre classification.
